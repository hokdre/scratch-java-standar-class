this is my notes while explore java builtin standar classes that can help us to automate some operation in particular data type and interect with runtime or System(jvm). I really suggest to watch this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZnMqTfBbOU&list=PL-CtdCApEFH-p_Q2GyK4K3ORoAT0Yt7CX&index=4


this video will be share about : 

1. How interact with String type in java including common operation like spliting, check empty or blank, how to optimize memorize memory while update the string with StringBuild and String Buffer cause string it's self is immutable and optimize while reading the string with StringTokenizer.
2. How to interact with Number, like converting from other data type and working with big number like large int or decimal, this data type is strongly recomended while we are need precission floating point , and some additional working with math package that can help us to rounding, pow, min, max, etc
3. How to interact with date, 2 class that java used to manage date type, it's Date and Calender, Date it's self going to deprecated, so there;s Calender class that we can use. <br/>
   Utility :
4. Arrays, help us to working with array like copy array, sort, serch and etc
5. Objects, help us to safe way call a common method of a object like toString,hashCode, equals. so we dont need check the null one by one.
6. Regex, help us to search pattern in a word
7. Random, help us to generate random data that support range data like integer 1-100, string a-z, etc
8. Properties, java has builtin configuration file .properties, we can store our configuration app on this file
9. uuid, help us to generate unique random uuid <br/>
   input output : 
10. Scanner, help us to read an input that can be from file , console, etc.
11. Base64, help us to encoding binary to text with safely. <br/>
    system : <br/>
12. System, help us to interact with environment where our app is running, in other langauge commonly os module, we can like kill our app, get current working directory, get env, etc. 
13. Runtime, give us information about state of our current running environments like total cpus, total memory free on jvm, total memory of jvm, we can use this class to monitoring and profilling our app metrics.
